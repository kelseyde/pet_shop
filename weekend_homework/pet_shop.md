# Ruby Pet Shop

Your task is to write functions to run a pet shop. There are tests in the `specs/` directory in the start point.

Feel free to write more tests as you go along and practice TDD. Once the test for a function is passing, uncomment the next test.

**Do not use the `@` symbol in your functions file `pet_shop.rb`**

Using the `@` symbol variables in your functions will cause problems. We will look into exactly what the `@` symbol is doing next week.

**The data in the test file is reset to how it started between each test**

This allows each test to be independent of each other. Changes to the data that you might do in one test won't affect other tests.
